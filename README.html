<p>Issue Exercise
We’d love to see an example of your work when you do a quick web page and design straight to code.</p>

<p>Pick an issue that’s motivating to you and create a campaign micro-site which includes a petition. It can be helpful to search the news to find a headline that makes you think, “I would love to run a campaign on that.” Write a short headline that will draw in your audience, a 5&#8211;7 sentence description about why they should care, and and a petition to a target on the campaign (it’s best if you do not use a template for the page). Add any images or video that you think help to make your case. The page should at least connect your campaign web page to a petition and it’s fine to use something simple like Action Network (it’s the CRM we use and you can get a free account). If you run out of time and have additional steps/ actions you’d want to take on the back end, just tell us how you would do it. Don’t spend more than 2&#8211;3 hours on this test and think of this as a first prototype for a client rather than the finished product. Please send the live site as well as in source code.</p>
